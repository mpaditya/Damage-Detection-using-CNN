# Damage-Detection-using-CNN

This repo contains the code and detailed technical report on experimenting with using simple CNN architectures on 2 problems - Fashion MNIST for baselining and NEU surface defect detection application. The effect of different hyperparameters were explored and the model's results were benchmarked against other models from literature.
